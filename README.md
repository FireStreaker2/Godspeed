Godspeed is a simple chrome extension blocker. It uses a whitelist type of blocking which is achievable by sorting through the current TLD of the website and checks through that. Moreover, it also checks for keywords within the current URL.

# Configuration
Go to ``index.js`` and add the TLDs you want to allow.
